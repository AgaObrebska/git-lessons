The Māori language word kiwi is generally accepted to be "of imitative origin" from the call.[9] However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *kiwi, which refers to Numenius tahitiensis, the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands.[10] With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the new-found bird.[11] The word is usually uncapitalised when used for the birds. The plural is either the anglicised kiwis[12] or, consistent with the Māori language, appearing as kiwi without an ‑s.[13]

The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek 'without wing': a- (ἀ-), 'without' or 'not'; ptéryx (πτέρυξ), 'wing'.[14]
